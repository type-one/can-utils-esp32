# Signals and MuxSignals in CAN Messages

In the context of CAN (Controller Area Network) messages, **Signals** and **MuxSignals** are concepts used to represent and organize the data being transmitted on the CAN bus. Let's break them down:

## Signals

### What Are Signals?
- Signals are the smallest pieces of data embedded within a CAN message.
- Each signal represents a specific parameter or piece of information, such as engine speed, temperature, or vehicle speed.
- Signals are encoded as bit fields within the data payload of the CAN message.

### How Are Signals Used?
- Signals are defined within a database, such as a **DBC file** or an **AUTOSAR description**.
- Each signal has metadata associated with it, including:
    - **Start bit**: The position of the signal in the message's payload.
    - **Length**: The number of bits the signal occupies.
    - **Scaling**: How to convert the raw value into meaningful data (e.g., RPM, km/h).
    - **Offset**: A value to adjust the raw data.
    - **Data type**: Whether the signal is unsigned, signed, etc.

## MuxSignals

### What Are MuxSignals?
- MuxSignals (short for **Multiplexer Signals**) are used to manage CAN messages with multiplexed data.
- Multiplexing allows a single CAN message to contain multiple sets of signals (or signal groups), depending on the value of a special signal called the **multiplexer signal**.

### How Do MuxSignals Work?
- The **multiplexer signal** acts as a "selector" for which signals are active in a given message.
- Based on the value of the multiplexer signal, different sets of signals are decoded from the message.
- This technique is often used to **optimize bandwidth** and reduce the number of CAN messages.

### Why Use MuxSignals?
- **Efficient Data Transmission**: Multiplexing is useful when there are many signals but not all are needed at the same time.
- **Example**:
    - When the multiplexer value is `0`, the message might encode data for a **steering module**.
    - When the multiplexer value is `1`, the same message might encode data for a **braking module**.

## Example of MuxSignals

Imagine a CAN message for a vehicle with different operating modes:
- **Multiplexer Signal**: Mode (value `0` = engine signals, value `1` = transmission signals).
- **Signals within Mode 0**: Engine speed, engine temperature.
- **Signals within Mode 1**: Gear position, transmission temperature.

The same message structure is reused for multiple modes by switching the multiplexer signal, reducing the number of unique messages on the bus.

## Defining Signals and MuxSignals in DBC Files

In **DBC (Database CAN)** files, Signals and MuxSignals are defined as part of the message definitions. DBC files describe the structure of CAN messages, including their IDs, signals, and multiplexing structure.

### 1. Signals

Signals in DBC files define how specific pieces of data are extracted or encoded within a CAN message. Their definitions include metadata such as start bit, signal length, scaling, and units.

#### Syntax:

```text
SG_ SignalName : StartBit|Length@Endianess(Scale,Offset) [Min|Max] "Unit" Receiver
```

#### Example:

```text
SG_ EngineSpeed : 24|16@1 (0.125,0) [0|8000] "rpm" ECU1,ECU2
```

This defines a signal named `EngineSpeed`:
- **Start Bit**: 24, spans **16 bits**.
- **Encoding**: Little Endian (`@1`).
- **Scaling**: `0.125` with **no offset**.
- **Valid Range**: 0 to 8000 rpm.
- **Receivers**: ECU1 and ECU2.

---

### 2. MuxSignals

MuxSignals allow a message to carry multiple groups of signals, determined by a special multiplexer signal. Their definition extends the standard signal syntax with a **Multiplexor field**.

#### Syntax:

```text
SG_ MultiplexerSignalName : StartBit|Length@Endianess(Scale,Offset) [Min|Max] "Unit" Receiver M
SG_ MultiplexedSignalName : StartBit|Length@Endianess(Scale,Offset) [Min|Max] "Unit" Receiver mMultiplexerValue
```

- **`M`**: Marks the signal as the multiplexer signal.
- **`mMultiplexerValue`**: Indicates the multiplexer value for which the signal is valid.

#### Example:

```text
SG_ Mode : 0|3@1 (1,0) [0|7] "Mode" ECU1 M 
SG_ EngineRPM : 8|16@1 (0.125,0) [0|8000] "rpm" ECU1 m0 
SG_ GearPosition : 8|8@1 (1,0) [0|255] "gear" ECU2 m1
```

Explanation:
- The `Mode` signal is the **multiplexer** (occupying bits 0–2).
- When `Mode == 0`, the **EngineRPM** signal is active (starting at bit 8).
- When `Mode == 1`, the **GearPosition** signal is active (starting at bit 8).

## Benefits of MuxSignals in DBC

- **Efficient Bandwidth Usage**: Only the signals relevant to the current multiplexer value are sent, reducing message overhead.
- **Organized Encoding**: Signals are grouped logically within a single message, making the system easier to manage.

# Advanced DBC File Format Concepts

The in-vehicle network communication leverages the CAN network to transmit information from the ECUs in automotive systems. The data representation of this information is captured via the **DBC (Database Container)** format.

This article covers concepts such as **keywords**, **attributes**, and **multiplexors**, along with a quick overview of popular editors and parsers. Let’s take a deep dive into DBC files!

---

## Keywords in DBC Files

Various keywords in a DBC file define and describe messages and signals. They provide valuable information for interpreting and decoding the data.

- **Version**: Indicates the version of the DBC file format being used to ensure compatibility.
    ```plaintext
    VERSION "RELEASE_1_2"
    ```

- **NS_**: Defines the namespace for messages and signals, organizing and categorizing them.

- **BO_**: Defines a message, including its identifier, attributes, and associated signals.

- **SG_**: Defines a signal, specifying its name, start position, size, data type, and attributes.

- **CM_**: Adds comments and annotations for additional context.

- **BA_ and BA_DEF_**: Define custom attributes for messages and signals.
    ```plaintext
    BA_ "ECUErrorState" BO_ 2000 1;
    BA_DEF_ BO_ "ECUErrorState" ENUM "No", "Yes";
    BA_DEF_DEF_ "ECUErrorState" "No";
    ```

## Message Attributes in DBC Files

DBC files include attributes to configure the timing and behavior of messages. Common attributes include:

- **GenMsgSendType**: Specifies transmission type (e.g., cyclic, triggered).
- **GenMsgCycleTime**: Defines the interval between consecutive message transmissions (in milliseconds).
- **GenMsgStartDelayTime**: Adds a delay before periodic message transmission begins.
- **GenMsgDelayTime**: Ensures a minimum delay between triggered message transmissions.

---

## Signal Attributes in DBC Files

Attributes can also be defined for individual signals:

- **GenSigStartValue**: Specifies a signal's initial value when the message is transmitted. It ensures the receiver uses a default value until the signal is received.

---

## Multiplexed Messages in DBC Files

Multiplexed messages use the same CAN ID to carry different sets of signals. A **multiplexer signal** selects which signals are transmitted. This optimizes bandwidth usage and reduces message count.

### Example:
In the following DBC structure:
```plaintext
SG_ SensorSelect : 0|8@1 (1,0) [0|1] "Selector" ECU1 M
SG_ Sensor1Value : 24|16@1 (0.1,0) [0|100] "Unit" ECU1 m0
SG_ Sensor2Value : 24|16@1 (0.1,0) [0|100] "Unit" ECU1 m1
